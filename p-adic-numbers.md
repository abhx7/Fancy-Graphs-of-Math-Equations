# Understanding \( p \)-Adic Numbers

The **\( p \)-adic numbers** are a fascinating extension of the usual number system, offering a different way to think about distances and convergence. Unlike real numbers, which rely on the **absolute value**, \( p \)-adic numbers use a **different norm**, based on divisibility by a prime \( p \). This perspective leads to unique properties and applications.

## What Are \( p \)-Adic Numbers?

### 1. **The Basics of \( p \)-Adic Numbers**
- The \( p \)-adic numbers are built around a **prime number \( p \)**.
- Instead of measuring how far apart two numbers are in the usual sense, the \( p \)-adic norm measures how divisible their difference is by \( p \).

### 2. **\( p \)-Adic Norm (\( |\cdot|_p \))**
- For any integer \( n \), the \( p \)-adic norm \( |n|_p \) is defined as:
  \[
  |n|_p = p^{-k},
  \]
  where \( k \) is the largest power of \( p \) dividing \( n \).

- **Examples**:
  - If \( p = 3 \) and \( n = 9 \), \( |9|_3 = 3^{-2} = \frac{1}{9} \) (since \( 9 = 3^2 \)).
  - If \( p = 3 \) and \( n = 10 \), \( |10|_3 = 1 \) (since \( 3 \) does not divide \( 10 \)).

## Why Are \( p \)-Adic Numbers Useful?

### 1. **Different Perspective on Distance**
- In the real numbers, numbers far apart in value have a large distance.
- In \( p \)-adic numbers, numbers divisible by higher powers of \( p \) are **closer** together.

### 2. **Infinite Expansions (Reverse of Base \( p \))**
- Every \( p \)-adic number can be represented as an **infinite series** in base \( p \):
  \[
  a_0 + a_1 p + a_2 p^2 + \dots, \quad \text{where } a_i \in \{0, 1, \dots, p-1\}.
  \]
- Example (\( p = 5 \)):
  - \( 13 \) in base \( 5 \) is \( 3 \cdot 5^0 + 2 \cdot 5^1 = 23_{10} \).
  - The \( 5 \)-adic expansion of \( -1 \) is \( \dots + 4 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 \), repeating \( 444\dots \).

## Key Properties of \( p \)-Adic Numbers

1. **Convergence Works Differently**:
   - In real numbers, \( 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \dots \to 0 \) because the terms get smaller.
   - In \( p \)-adic numbers, convergence depends on divisibility by \( p \). For example:
     \[
     1 + p + p^2 + p^3 + \dots \to \frac{1}{1-p}.
     \]

2. **Non-Archimedean Property**:
   - For \( p \)-adic numbers, the triangle inequality becomes stronger:
     \[
     |x + y|_p \leq \max(|x|_p, |y|_p).
     \]
   - This means the larger term dominates the sum in terms of distance.

3. **Unique Arithmetic**:
   - The \( p \)-adic system provides tools for solving problems in modular arithmetic and understanding congruences.

## Applications of \( p \)-Adic Numbers

1. **Number Theory**:
   - \( p \)-adic numbers are a cornerstone in modern number theory, including proving Fermat’s Last Theorem.

2. **Cryptography**:
   - Concepts in \( p \)-adic analysis underlie many cryptographic algorithms.

3. **Physics**:
   - Some theories in quantum mechanics and string theory use \( p \)-adic numbers to explore alternative models of spacetime.

4. **Dynamic Systems**:
   - \( p \)-adic numbers help analyze behaviors in systems that rely on modular arithmetic.

## Intuitive Analogy

In Veritasium's video:
- The \( p \)-adic world flips our usual concept of distance:
  - Large numbers (with higher powers of \( p \)) can be **closer**.
  - Imagine numbers as layers of divisibility—closer layers share more divisors with \( p \).

- Example:
  - For \( p = 3 \), the numbers \( 9, 27, 81, \dots \) are extremely close because they are divisible by increasing powers of \( 3 \).

---

## Further Exploration

- **Visualizing \( p \)-Adic Numbers**:
  - Think of the \( p \)-adic expansion as a "tree," where each level corresponds to increasing powers of \( p \), branching out into possible coefficients.

- **Relation to Real Numbers**:
  - \( p \)-adic numbers offer an alternative completion of the rationals, similar to real numbers but using a different norm.
